## OVERVIEW AND HDL LEVELS

Verilog is used to describe digital system at the,

* Behavioral Level - Good for testing
* Register Transfer Level (RTL)
* Gate Level
* Switch Level

## GATE PRIMATIVES

You can model gate primitives at the gate level with,

```verilog
    and(xy, x, y);
    nand(xy, x, y);
    or();
    nor();
    or();
    nor();
```

OPERATORS

```verilog
#ARITHMATIC

    *   // Multiply
