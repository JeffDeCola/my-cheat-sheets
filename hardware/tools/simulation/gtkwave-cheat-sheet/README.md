## INSTALL GTKWave

### WINDOWS & macOS (BINARY)

Install binary from
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/).

### LINUX

Grab source from from
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/).

You may need to install some packages,

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install tk-dev tcl-dev liblzma-dev gtk+2.0 gperf
./configure
make
su
make install
exit
which gtkwave
gtkwave -v
```

## CHECK INSTALL

Just open up the executable.

## VCD FILE

Mainly I will use this to look at `*.vcd` files created by a verilog simulator
such as
[iverilog](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/simulation/iverilog-cheat-sheet).

A .vcd (Value Change Dump) file is an industry standard file format
generated by most Verilog simulators and is specified in IEEE-1364.

## SCRIPT TO OPEN GTKWave VIA SHELL

To make things easier when viewing a waveform, I wrote a script that will
automatically launch GTKWave with your saved `*.gtkw` file from Windows WSL,
macOS or Linux.

The script
[launch-gtkwave.sh](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-verilog-examples/blob/master/launch-GTKWave-script/launch-gtkwave.sh)
is located in my repo
[my-verilog-examples](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-verilog-examples).
