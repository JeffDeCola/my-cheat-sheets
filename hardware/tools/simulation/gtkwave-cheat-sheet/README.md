## INSTALL GTKWave

I installed `GTKWave` for waveform viewing.

### Install Binary

Install binary from
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/).

## CHECK

Just open up the executable.

## VCD FILE

Mainly I will use this to look at `*.vcd` files created by a verilog simulator
such as
[iverilog](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/simulation/iverilog-cheat-sheet).

A .vcd (Value Change Dump) file is an industry standard file format
generated by most Verilog simulators and is specified in IEEE-1364.
