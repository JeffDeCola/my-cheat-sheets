## REPORT PROCEEDS OF SELLING A SECURITY

A security can be a stock/bond/crypto/etc.

Usually you get a **1099-B** from a broker that will show all your proceeds
from selling your securities (Capital Assets).  You report these proceeds on
**FORM 8949** (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets)
and add all the totals on
**SCHEDULE D** (Capital Gains and Losses).

```text
PROCEEDS (SALE) - COST = CAPITAL GAIN/LOSS
```

### FORM 8949

This is were you list each sale or combined sales.

There are 6 Boxes to check depending on the following,

* **HAVE 1099-B REPORTED TO IRS**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX A)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX D)
* **HAVE 1099-B NOT REPORTED TO IRS (RARE)**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX B)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX E)
* **DON'T HAVE A 1099-B**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX C)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX F)
