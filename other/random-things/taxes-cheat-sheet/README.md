### REPORT PROCEEDS OF SELLING A CAPITAL ASSET

A Capital Asset can be a stock/bond/crypto/etc.

#### STEP 1 - RECEIVE A 1099-B - WHAT YOU SOLD

Usually you get a **1099-B** from a broker that will list all your proceeds
from selling your Capital Assets.
It will also show if this was a long-term sale (held more than a year),
a short-term sale (held less than a year) or a portion of both.

#### STEP 2 - SALES ON FORM 8949

You report these proceeds (sales) on
**8949** (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets).

```text
PROCEEDS (SALE) - COST = CAPITAL GAIN/LOSS
```

There are 6 Boxes to check depending on the following,

* **HAVE 1099-B REPORTED TO IRS**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX A)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX D)
* **HAVE 1099-B NOT REPORTED TO IRS (RARE)**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX B)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX E)
* **DON'T HAVE A 1099-B**
  * SHORT-TERM SALES (BOX C)
  * LONG-TERM SALES (BOX F)

You may list each sale or combine the sales together to save time.
I like to combine.

#### STEP 3 - TOTALS ON SCHEDULE D

Now add all the totals from all your **8949** and put on
**SCHEDULE D** (Capital Gains and Losses).
