_Famous quotes I like._

---
_"I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself, I seem to have been
only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in
finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered before me."_

\- **Isaac Newton**

_"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest
person to fool."_

\- **Richard Feynman**
