_Quotes I like._

---
_"I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself, I seem to have been
only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in
finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered before me."_

\- **Isaac Newton**

_"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest
person to fool."_

\- **Richard Feynman**

_"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."_

\- **William Shakespeare** _(Macbeth)_
