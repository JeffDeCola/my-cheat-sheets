# NOTABLE EQUATIONS CHEAT SHEET

`notable equations` _is my list of beautiful and ground breaking
equations._

This cheat sheet was built using,

* LaTex Math Mode equations rendered to images using
  [readme2tex-pgfplots](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/readme2tex-pgfplots)
* Graphs were created in
  [my-latex-pgfplots-graphs](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-latex-pgfplots-graphs)
  repo using the LaTeX `pgfplots` package

You can see my
[LaTeX Math Mode cheat sheet](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/development/languages/latex-math-mode-cheat-sheet)
on how to do this.

#### LINEAR EQUATION

A linear equation is the equation of any straight line,
