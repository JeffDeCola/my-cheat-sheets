## OVERVIEW

Here is an illustration of what we're going to do,

![IMAGE - mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer - IMAGE](../../../../docs/pics/mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer.jpg)

## MINER

`FunakoshiMiner` is a Equihash CUDA Miner.  So it works with ZEC and ETH
but not bitcoin.

Grab the latest Windows binary from
[github.com/funakoshi2718/funakoshi-miner](https://github.com/funakoshi2718/funakoshi-miner)
and place the folder anywhere on your rig.

## RUN

To run on `slushpool.com` create a `start.bat` file,

```bash
setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 1
setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100
setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1
setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100

funakoshiMiner.exe \
--server us-east.zec.slushpool.com \
--port 4444 \
--user <USER>.<WORKER>
-tele-port 10052
```

## MONITOR

Because you set the port above, you can monitor your miner,

[http://localhost:10052](http://localhost:10052)

Thats it, you're mining and wasting electricity.
