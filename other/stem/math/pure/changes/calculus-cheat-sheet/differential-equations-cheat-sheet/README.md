## OVERVIEW

* **Calculus** is a broad field of mathematics that includes 
differentiation (finding derivatives) and
integration (finding integrals).
It focuses on rates of change and accumulation.

* **Differential** equations (DiffEQ) are a specific branch of mathematics
that deals with equations involving derivatives.
A differential equation expresses a relationship between a function and its derivatives.
As we will see, differential equations are used to
model real-world phenomena involving rates of
change and accumulation.

For example, this is a differential equation,

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x
$$

and this is a derivative,

$$
y = xÂ²
$$

As you can see, differential equations use calculus.
