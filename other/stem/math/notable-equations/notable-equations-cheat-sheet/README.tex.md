# NOTABLE EQUATIONS CHEAT SHEET

`notable equations` _is my list of beautiful and ground breaking math
equations._

This cheat sheet was built using,

* LaTex Math Mode equations rendered to images using
  [readme2tex-pgfplots](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/readme2tex-pgfplots)
* Graphs were created in
  [my-latex-graphs](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-latex-graphs)
  repo using the LaTeX graph packages

You can see my
[Latex](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/development/languages/latex-cheat-sheet)
and
[LaTeX Math Mode](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/blob/master/software/development/languages/latex-cheat-sheet/latex-math-mode.md)
cheat sheets for more information.

#### LINEAR EQUATION

A linear equation is the equation of any straight line,

$$
\boxed{y = mx + b}
$$

Where $m$ is the `slope` of the line and $b$ is the `y-intercept`.
