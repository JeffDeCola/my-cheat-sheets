## OVERVIEW

To understand cryptocurrency you must understand blockchain.

From a developerâ€™s perspective you can create an immutable history of data on a
blockchain. Once data is stored on a blockchain, it
is guaranteed that that data will not be deleted, modified,
or forged without a trace of the action.

The data for cryptocurrency is the transactions.

The reason to add to the chain is keep it unhackable.

## TOP CURRENCIES

There are hundreds of currencies, these are my favorites.

* Proof Type: PoW
* Example of a Wallet:
  [btc.com](https://btc.com/bc1q7ukm7lezz8qc5mjx9qjnpa7jq059qveqzvt38p)
* Bitcoins can be mined every 10 minutes
* Every 4 years that number gets cut in half
* Mining ends in 2140 at 21,000,000 bitcoins

### DAI (DAI)

  [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBWTLKXCMOW3OGCVUQBBMK2DK5ZVGWJBRZWTHYVDBM67CHET7YIUJ7IE)
* Transactions take only 5 seconds
* Transactions cost a tiny fraction of a penny
* Stellar does not burn electricity to mine like Ethereum or Bitcoin)
* A person can send a token or currency to another user, magically
  transforming it to a different token in the process.

### ZCASH (ZEC)

* Launch: 2016
* Official website:
  [z.cash](https://z.cash/)
* Can you mine: **YES**
* Hash: Equihash based
* Max Supply: 21,000,000
* Proof Type: PoW
* Example of a Wallet:
  [explorer.zcha.in](https://explorer.zcha.in/accounts/t1dsSDxhm8WN5XistRCkezFXsdTqsFAx7gE)

The Block Rewards will issue a total of 50 Zcash (ZEC) every 10 mins.
The block spacing is 2.5 mins, so each block produces 12.5 ZEC.
10% of all coins mined will go to the Founders Reward.

I installed their ZecWallet from
[here](https://z.cash/download/).

If you use the Windows Desktop `ZecWallet` the data is stored in,

```txt
C:/Users/Jeff/AppData/Roaming/Zcash/zcash.conf
```

## WALLETS & EXCHANGE

There is a difference.

### WALLET

A Wallet has the ability to,

* Send
* Receive

Pros,

* You can use your bitcoin

### EXCHANGE

The ability to,

* Buy
* Sell
* Convert

Pros,

* Get money in and out of bitcoin

### HYBRID

Like coinbase, its a mix of the two and it can be confusing.

### PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WALLETS

A `Private Wallet` is just that, private.
You have a wallet address.  You own that address.
A private wallet is one which the individual fully controls
(has custody of) both the public and private keys.

For example, here is a private wallet for XLM Lumens,
[Stellar Lumens (XLM) Private Wallet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBKIQHJT7QP6JVLQZRHR7XQMKBFCN5ZCB5BZMEAGVTTZIJTBBZANMTK5)

A `Public Wallet` is just that, used by many people.
But you now need a unique identifier to determine who you are,
hence a Destination Tag/Memo. Coinbase uses Public Wallets.

## MINING

Mining is basically finding a nonce that will give
you a hash with the first 10 digits of all zero.
And whoever figures it out gets coins.
Hence, computational power if the key.

First, you choose your hardware and find the software that works with it.

* Hardware
  * CPU
  * GPU
  * ASIC

You can also join a pool which you contribute with your
computations and share in the pools rewards.

The metric used is H/s (hashes per second)
or Sol/s (SOLutions per Second).
