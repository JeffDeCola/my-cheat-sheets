## OVERVIEW

Here is an illustration of what we're going to do,

![IMAGE - mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer - IMAGE](../../../../docs/pics/mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer.jpg)

## MINER

`lolMiner` is also a BEAM CUDA Miner.

Grab the latest Windows binary from
[github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases/)
and place the folder anywhere on your rig.

## POOL

You can use any pool. For this example we're going to use
[2miners.com](https://2miners.com/)
which doesn't require an account.

The only thing you need is a personal wallet address
that you will place in the .bat file below.

## RUN

### SOLO POOL

To run on `2miners.com` SOLO pool create a `start.bat` file,

```bash
setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 1
setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100
setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1
setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100

lolMiner.exe
--coin BEAM
--pool us-solo-beam.2miners.com
--port 5454
--user <WALLET>.<WORKER>
--apiport 10051
```

### NORMAL POOL

To run on `2miners.com` normal pool just change the pool and port,

```bat
--pool us-beam.2miners.com
--port 5252
```

## MONITOR

You can locally monitor your mining software,

[localhost:10051/summary](http://localhost:10051/summary)

Thats it, you're mining and wasting electricity.
