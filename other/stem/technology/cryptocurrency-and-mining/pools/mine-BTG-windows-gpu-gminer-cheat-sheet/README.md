## OVERVIEW

Here is an illustration of what we're going to do,

![IMAGE - mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer - IMAGE](../../../../docs/pics/mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer.jpg)

## MINER

`gminer` can mine quit a bit of different coins.

Grab the latest Windows binary from
[github.com/develsoftware/GMinerRelease/releases](https://github.com/develsoftware/GMinerRelease/releases/)
and place the folder anywhere on your rig.

## POOL

You can use any pool. For this example we're going to use
[2miners.com](https://2miners.com/)
which doesn't require an account.

The only thing you need is a personal wallet address
that you will place in the .bat file below.

## RUN

### SOLO POOL

To run on `2miners.com` SOLO pool create a `start.bat` file,

```bash
miner.exe
--algo 144_5
--pers BgoldPoW
--server us-solo-btg.2miners.com
--port 4040
--user <WALLET>.<WORKER>
--pass x
--api 10050
```

### NORMAL POOL

To run on `2miners.com` normal pool just change the pool and port,

```bat
--server us-btg.2miners.com
--port 4040
```

## MONITOR

You can locally monitor your mining software,

[localhost:10050](http://localhost:10050/)

Thats it, you're mining and wasting electricity.
