## OVERVIEW

Here is an illustration of what we're going to do,

![IMAGE - mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer - IMAGE](../../../../docs/pics/mine-XYZ-windows-gpu-XYZminer.jpg)

## MINER

`t-rex` can mine quit a bit of different coins.

Grab the latest Windows binary from
[github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releases](https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releases/)
and place the folder anywhere on your rig.

## POOL

You can use any pool. For this example we're going to use
[2miners.com](https://2miners.com/)
which doesn't require an account.

The only thing you need is a personal wallet address
that you will place in the .bat file below.

## RUN

### SOLO POOL

To run on `2miners.com` SOLO pool create a `start.bat` file,

```bash
t-rex.exe
-a x16r
--fork-at x16rv2=2019-10-01T16:00:00
-o stratum+tcp://solo-rvn.2miners.com:7070
-u <WALLET>.<WORKER>
-p x
```

### NORMAL POOL

To run on `2miners.com` normal pool just change the pool and port,

```bat
-o stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060
```

## MONITOR

You can locally monitor your mining software,

[10.141.141.1:4067/trex](http://10.141.141.1:4067/trex)

Thats it, you're mining and wasting electricity.
