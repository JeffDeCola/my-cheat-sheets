## WHY IS IT CALLED WI-FI

Who knows. I would guess because it sounds cool.

## VERSIONS

These are pretty big approximations,

## SECURITY LEVELS

In order of security (with encryption),

* WEP (RC4) - Never use, easily hacked
* WPA (TKIP) - Don't use
* WPA (AES) - Don't use
* WPA-PSK (TKIP) - Don't use
* WPA-PSK (AES) - Don't use
* WPA2-PSK (TKIP) - Don't use
* **WPA2-PSK (AES)** - Use this, simple and easy, also called personal or home
* WPA2 (TKIP) - Don't use
* **WPA2 (AES)** - This is the highest level, also called enterprise

Do not use mixed mode, just select WPA2-PSK (AES).

PSK is Pre-Shared Key. Also called personal.  Provide router with Plain english key.
