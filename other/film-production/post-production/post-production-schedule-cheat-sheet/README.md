## OVERVIEW

Obviously, a post production schedule will depend on many factors,
but I feel this might be a good starting point.
I broke this up into pre-picture lock and post-picture lock.
These can overlap and be done somewhat in parallel, but for simplicity
I kept them separate.

## PRE-PICTURE LOCK

* **WEEK 1-6 (DURING PRODUCTION)**
  * DAILIES/ASSEMBLY
    * _Editor_
    * Scenes get shown to Director et al.
    * Director provides feedback throughout this process
    * This process can start on the first day of principle photography
    * Allows director to make adjustments on set or refilm a scene
* **WEEK 7**
  * **EDITORS CUT 1.0**
    * _Editor_
    * Send to Producers, etc. for feedback

    * After 1st CUT, the Editor and Director work together in an editing suite
  * OTHER CUTS
    * _Editor, Director, Producers_
    * 2nd CUT, 3rd CUT, etc.
    * These are not official cuts, just to get feedback
    * Start to involve composer

    * _Editor, Director and Producer_
    * Reels/notes to Sound House – Temp sound with additional sound elements
      (dialog, effects, and room noise)
    * Reels/notes to Color House/Post Production Facility –
      Extreme high quality with temp sound
    * Reels/notes to Composer, Music Editor, and Recording Studio –
      no music, just dialog
    * Notes/list to Visual Effects House

## POST-PICTURE LOCK

schedule of the post houses. I suggest getting
a post production supervisor. This schedule would be ideal, but nothing is ideal.
