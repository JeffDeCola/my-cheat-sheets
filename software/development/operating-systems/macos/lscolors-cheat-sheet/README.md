## OVERVIEW

The `ls` that comes with macOS is from `BSD`, and lacks some
of the features of its GNU sibling.

Setting `ls` color for linux is
[here](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/development/operating-systems/linux/ls_colors-cheat-sheet).

## BSD - SET LSCOLORS ENV VARIABLE

Its pretty simple,

```bash
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExGxBxDxCxEgEdxbxgxcxd
```

For grep add,

```bash
export GREP_OPTIONS='--color=always'
export GREP_COLOR='01;31'
```

A limitation is that you can't set different file
extensions like .gz.
