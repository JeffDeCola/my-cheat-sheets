## OVERVIEW

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the ability of a
machine to perform cognitive processes.

## TYPES OF AI

AI can be looked at in two ways; How good it is (Capabilities) and what it can
do (Functionality).

* CAPABILITY
  * **Machine Learning** (Narrow AI / Weak AI)
    * Designed for a specific task
  * **Machine Intelligence** (General AI / Strong AI)
    * Can perform any intellectual task that a human can
  * **Machine Consciousness** (Superintelligent AI)
    * AI that surpasses human intelligence
* FUNCTIONALITY
  * **Reactive Machines**
    * Can only react to current situations
  * **Limited Memory**
    * Can learn from the past
  * **Theory of Mind**
    * Can understand human emotions
  * **Self Awareness**
    * AI that has consciousness

## MACHINE LEARNING

Today, Machine learnings is the most popular subset of AI
that allows a system to learn from data. It copies human brain neural networks.
Machine learning are used in various functional AI types(above)
such as reactive machines, limited memory and theory of mind (hypothetical).

* **Machine Learning** (ML)
  * Classical Learning
    * Supervised Learning
    * Unsupervised Learning
  * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) / DEEP LEARNING
    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    * Other Neural Network Architectures
  * Ensemble Learning
  * Reinforcement Learning

### CLASSICAL LEARNING

Classical learning is the most common type of machine learning.
It can be broken down into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised.

* **Supervised Learning**
  * The system is given input data and the correct output.
  * The system learns to predict the output from the input data.
  * The system is trained using labeled data.
  * The system is tested using labeled data.
  * The system learns from the mistakes made during training.
  * The system is then used to make predictions on new data.

* **Unsupervised Learning**
  * The system is given input data without the correct output.
  * The system learns to find patterns in the data.
  * The system is trained using unlabeled data.
  * The system is tested using unlabeled data.
  * The system learns from the mistakes made during training.
  * The system is then used to make predictions on new data.
