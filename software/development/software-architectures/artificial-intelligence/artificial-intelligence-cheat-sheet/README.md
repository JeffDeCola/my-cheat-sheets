## OVERVIEW

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the ability of a
machine to perform cognitive processes.

## TYPES OF AI

AI can be looked at in two ways; How good it is (Capabilities) and what it can
do (Functionality).

### CAPABILITY

* **Machine Learning** (Narrow AI / Weak AI)
  * Designed for a specific task
* **Machine Intelligence** (General AI / Strong AI)
  * Can perform any intellectual task that a human can
* **Machine Consciousness** (Superintelligent AI)
  * AI that surpasses human intelligence

### FUNCTIONALITY

* **Reactive Machines**
  * Can only react to current situations
* **Limited Memory**
  * Can learn from the past
* **Theory of Mind**
  * Can understand human emotions
* **Self Awareness**
  * AI that has consciousness

## MACHINE LEARNING

Today, Machine learnings is the most popular subset of AI
that allows a system to learn from data.
Machine learning are used in various functional AI types (above)
such as reactive machines, limited memory and theory of mind (hypothetical).

* **Machine Learning** (ML)
  * **Classical Learning**
    * Supervised Learning
      * Classification
      * Regression
    * Unsupervised Learning
      * Clustering
      * Pattern Recognition
      * Dimensionality Reduction Visualization
  * **Deep Learning** (Neural Networks)
    * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    * Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    * Other Neural Networks
  * **Ensemble Learning**
    * Boosting
    * Bagging
    * Stacking
  * **Reinforcement Learning**

### CLASSICAL LEARNING

Classical learning is the most common type of machine learning.
It can be broken down into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised.
Both systems learn from mistakes and makes predictions on new data.

#### SUPERVISED LEARNING

In supervised learning, the system is given input data and the correct output
The system learns to predict the output from the input data.

* **Classification**
  * Used for predicting a category
* **Regression**
  * Used for predicting a quantity

#### UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

In unsupervised learning, the system is given input data without the correct
output and the system learns to find patterns in the data.

* **Clustering**
  * Used for grouping similar data
* **Pattern Recognition**
  * Used for finding patterns in data
* **Dimensionality Reduction Visualization**
  * Used for reducing the number of features in data

### DEEP LEARNING (NEURAL NETWORKS)

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks.
It is the most popular type of machine learning today. A Neural Network is a
working system at the heart of a Deep Learning algorithm that helps it process
raw data.

* **Neural Networks**
  * Like a human brain
  * A network of nodes that are interconnected
  * Each node is a neuron that is connected to other neurons
  * The network can learn from data, improve itself and make decisions

There are many types of neural networks,

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
  * Used for sequential data
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
  * Used for image data
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**
  * Used for generating new data
* **Other Neural Networks**
  * Many other types of neural networks

### ENSEMBLE LEARNING

Ensemble learning is when you take multiple machine learning algorithms
and combine them to make a more powerful model.
Ensemble Learning

* **Boosting**
  * Used for reducing bias
* **Bagging**
  * Used for reducing variance
* **Stacking**
  * Used for reducing bias and variance

### REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is used to
train an agent to make a sequence of decisions.
