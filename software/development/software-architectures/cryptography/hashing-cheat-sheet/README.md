_Hashing (fingerprinting) is changing a message into an unreadable string not for
the purpose of hiding the message, but more for verifying the
contents of the message._

## OVERVIEW

Cryptography is the art of changing a message from a readable format,
referred to as `plaintext`, into an unreadable one, or `ciphertext`.

Two common hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA.  Hashing is obviously not reversible.
