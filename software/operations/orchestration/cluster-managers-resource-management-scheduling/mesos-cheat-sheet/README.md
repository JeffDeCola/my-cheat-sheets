## OVERVIEW (MESOS, MESOSPHERE & MESOS DC/OS)

`Mesos` is a project by Apache that gives you the
ability to run both containerized, and non-containerized
workloads in a distributed manner.
Mesos is complicated and hard to manage, so mesosphere
tries to make mesos into something understandable.

`Mesosphere` has a marathon “plugin” to mesos, which is an
easy way to manage container orchestration over mesos.

`Mesos DC/OS` (Data Center Operating System) simplifies mesos
even further and allows you to deploy your own mesos cluster,
with marathon, in a matter of minutes.

## INSTALL

This is out of the scope of this cheat sheet.
I used a vagrant file.

## FRAMEWORK - MARATHON

Mesos provides resource management and scheduling
while a framework such as marathon provides
scheduling and execution.

There are many types of frameworks that a designed to do different
things such as data storage, or processing.
Marathon is design to keep an app running forever.
