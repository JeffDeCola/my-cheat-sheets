## SLACK NOTIFICAITON

Send slack a grafana notifcation (from an alert).

At Slack setup an incomming webhook.

The end result will give you a URL like:

```bash
https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx/xxx/xxx
```

Test your webhook,

```bash
curl -X POST --data-urlencode \
    'payload={"channel": "#grafana-alert", "username": "jeff", "text": \
    "This is posted to #grafana-alert and comes from a bot named Jeff.", \
    "icon_emoji": ":ghost:"}' \
    https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx/xxx/xxx
```

To get the slack notification link to works,

Normally its,

```bash
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/xxx
```

But the ip is not filled in.

Edit the configuration .ini file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
```

```bash
The http port  to use
;http_port = 3000

The public facing domain name used to access grafana from a browser
;domain = localhost
```

Change the port and domain appropriately.

Restart service,

sudo service grafana-server restart
