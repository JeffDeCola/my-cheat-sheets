## GCF, GAE, GKE & GCE (THE ENGINES ON GCP)

What are the main differences between `google cloud functions`,
`google app engine`, `google kubernetes engine` and
`google compute engine`?

* FaaS -
  [Google Cloud Functions (gcf)](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-architectures/function-as-a-service/google-cloud-functions-cheat-sheet)
  * Severless
  * Events.
* PaaS -
  [Google App Engine (gae)](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-architectures/platform-as-a-service/google-app-engine-cheat-sheet)
  * A higher level of abstraction. Serverless. Focus is on your code.
  * Auto scales for you. Will create more instances as needed.
  * Google worries about infrastructure, you worry about code.
    Simply deploy your code and platform does the rest.
  * You don't manage or update the OS.
* CaaS -
  [Google Kubernetes Engine (gke)](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-architectures/containers-as-a-service/google-kubernetes-engine-cheat-sheet)
  * A step up from `gce` that uses Containers to manage your App.
  * Immutable OS (Unable to be changed - Can't modify the OS).
  * Autoscaling.
  * GCE Resources integrated. Kubernetes runs on `gce`.
* IaaS -
  [Google Compute Engine (gce)](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-architectures/infrastructure-as-a-service/google-compute-engine-cheat-sheet)
  * You have full control/responsibility for server.
  * Create your own VM instance by allocating hardware specific resources
    (e.g. RAM, CPU, Storage).
  * Direct access to OS.
  * Manage OS and updates as needed.

So what is this all good for?

* `gcf`
  * Web.
* `gae`
  * Web services with large scaling.
  * Quick scaling.
* `gke`
  * Micro services.
  * Container services.
  * Plan to cross cloud.
* `gce`
  * Small services.
  * Larger scale high performance service.

Here is a high-level illustration,

![IMAGE -  gce-vs-gke-vs-gae - IMAGE](../../../docs/pics/gce-vs-gke-vs-gae.jpg)

## GET AN ACCOUNT AT GCP

First setup a
[google cloud platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
account.

Create a Project which will have a name and ID.
Then submit your billing information.

* [Redeem a Promotion](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/redeem)
* [Your gcp Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)

## IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM) - SERVICE ACCOUNTS

Allowing Apps & users access & rights via service accounts.

As an illustration,

![IMAGE -  gcp-cloud-identity-and-access-management- IMAGE](../../../docs/pics/gcp-cloud-identity-and-access-management.jpg)

You create service account and define the roles those users or Apps can do.

The big roles are the project roles,

* Owner
* Editor
* Viewer
* Browser

But you can fine tune roles to only a access certain services like
`gce`, `gae`, etc....

To see what service accounts you have access too on your local machine,

```bash
gcloud auth list
```

To add an account on your local machine,

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=credential_key.json
```

You can switch accounts on your local machine,

```bash
gcloud config set account <ACCOUNT>
```

Or switch projects on your local machine,

```bash
gcloud config set project <my_project>
```

To create a service account key,

These are the steps,

* In Google Developers Console select a project.
* Under the "API & Services" section, click "Credentials".
* Click the "Create credentials" button, select "Service account key".
* Choose JSON as the Key type and gce as service account and click "Create".
* A JSON file will be downloaded automatically. This is your account file.

I would put the credentials file here,

```bash
$HOME/.config/gcloud/<name>.json
```

Set an environment variable in `~/.bashrc` to point to your service account file,

```bash
export GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH='/home/jeff/.config/gcloud/<name>.json'
```

Then you can use this env variables in your deployments and
it is kept secret on your local machine.

## INTERACTING WITH GCP

There are a few ways to interact with `gcp`,

* Using the gui/console.
* Using the SDK cli (e.g. `gcloud`). See below.
* Using Google Cloud Client Libraries / API
  (e.g. [go](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/api/libraries#google_apis_go_client_library)).
  My [go example](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/cloud-services/google-gcp).

## GCLOUD CLI

[Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)
is a command-line interface for Google Cloud
Platform products and services.

These include,

* `gcloud`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/),
  [reference](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/)
  provides the primary command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform.
* `gsutil`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil),
  is the command-line tool for
  [google cloud storage](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-providers/google-cloud-platform-cheat-sheet/google-cloud-storage.md).
* `bq`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool),
  is the command-line tool for BigQuery.

### GCLOUD CLI - INSTALL

There is great documentation online to install the SDK on your
particular platform [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

### GCLOUD CLI - CONFIGURE

```bash
gcloud init
```

You will be asked to attached a GCP project and a default compute region.
When complete, check your active configuration,

```bash
gcloud config list
gcloud auth list
gcloud info
```

See what components you have installed,

```bash
gcloud components list
```

You can add components as needed. For example,
to add `gae` go extensions,

```bash
gcloud components update
gcloud components install app-engine-go
```

Your configuration file is located `~/.boto`.

To change your default region/zone,

```bash
gcloud config set compute/region NAME
gcloud config set compute/zone NAME
```

For more information on the configuration file `.boto` go
[here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config).

## SOME BASIC GCP COMMANDS

GCP Help,

```bash
gcloud help
```

Version,

```bash
gcloud -v
```
