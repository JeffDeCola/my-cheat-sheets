_Amazon web services (aws) is a massive suite of cloud computing services like
[microsoft azure](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-providers/microsoft-azure-cheat-sheet)
or
[google cloud platform (gcp)](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-providers/google-cloud-platform-cheat-sheet)._

## GET AN ACCOUNT AT AWS

First setup a
[aws](https://aws.amazon.com/)
account.

## IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM) - ACCESS KEYS

AWS makes access easy via access keys.

There are two basic types,

* Users
* Roles (for apps)

Where Users have groups & policies and Roles (apps) have just policies.

As an illustration,

![IMAGE -  gcp-cloud-identity-and-access-management- IMAGE](../../../docs/pics/gcp-cloud-identity-and-access-management.jpg)

Refer to the console
[here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home)

Its pretty straightforward to create an access key for a app or a user.

Use `awc` cli to create your local ~/.aws credential files (see below).

## VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch
Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that
you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional
network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits
of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

I'm assuming this is like projects in `gcp`.

You will need one, so go
[here](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-west-1)
to make one.

## INTERACTING WITH AWS

There are a few ways to interact with `aws`,

* Using the gui/console.
* Using the aws cli (e.g. `aws`). See below.
* Using aws SDK Client Libraries / API
  (e.g. [go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)).
  My [go example](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/cloud-services/amazon-aws).

This cheat sheet will focus on `aws`.

## AWS CLI

[aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
is a command-line interface for aws
products and services.

### AWS CLI - INSTALL

Install using pip,

```python
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
```

On my macbook it placed the binary in,

```txt
~/Library/Python/3.7/bin
```

On ubuntu it places in,

```txt
~/.local/bin
```

Update your path in ~/.bashrc

```bash
export PATH=~/Library/Python/3.7/bin:$PATH
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
```

See the version,

```bash
aws --version
```

### AWS CLI - CONFIGURE

```bash
aws configure
```

It will ask you to enter,

```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Default region name [None]: us-west-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

It will place a configuration & configuration in,

```txt
~/.aws/config
~/.aws/credentials
```

## SOME BASIC AWS COMMANDS

GCP Help,

```bash
aws help
```

Version,

```bash
aws --v
```
