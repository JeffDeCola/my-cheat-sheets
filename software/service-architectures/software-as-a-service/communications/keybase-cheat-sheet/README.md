# KEYBASE CHEAT SHEET

`keybase` is secure groups, files and chat for everyone. It also has
encrypted private and group repos.

View my entire list of cheat sheets on
[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/).

## WHY DO YOU NEED THIS

I use it for the `encrypted repos` hosted at keybase.io.
It is not like github where you can goto the website and do PR, etc.
Its just a place to keep a repo that is encrypted end-to-end.

Hence this program is connected to your keybase account
and will encrypt your data before it is sent to the repo.

Refer to your keybase app to create a repo and then just use normal git.
